    This Function is Service Routine Function and it does the following:
    1) Read the request provided by the user from :mod 'controller'.
    2) Create a goal using the user data.

    4) A timeout is used to prevent infinite waiting in case the target is out of the range of the robot.
    5) If the target is reached or if the timeout is over the service return to user_controller.
